### Hi there, I'm Eden 👋

I’m a Software Engineer interested in the applications of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I have experience in Python, Java, JavaScript (including React.js), SQL, C/C++, and have worked on frontend dev, backend dev, and mobile dev.

- 🌱 I am a graduate of Cornell's Break Through Tech AI Program, and studying on the intelligent systems track at Columbia University.
- 🔭 At the moment, I'm learning about Computer Vision and starting a project in it.
