### Hi there, I'm Eden ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer interested in the applications of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I have experience in Python, Java, JavaScript (including React.js), SQL, C/C++, HTML, CSS, AWS deployment (Amplify, Lambda, S3, EC2, Cloudfront), and have worked on frontend dev, backend dev, and mobile dev.

- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for the NYC-based startup, [Anote](https://anote.ai).
- ðŸŒ± I am a graduate of Cornell's Break Through Tech AI Program, and studying both Computer Science (on the intelligent systems track) and Math at Columbia University. Some cool classes I've taken: Systems Programming, Parallel Optimization, Theory of Computation, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations
- ðŸ”­ At the moment, I'm learning about using Computer Vision and deep learning to play a video game.
